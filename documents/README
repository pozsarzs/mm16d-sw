Operating program for MM16D device
----------------------------------

1. About software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It is a stand-alone grow house control device. It takes the environmental
data from the MM17D connected to it via the serial port. It uploads the
received data and the status data of the device to a remote database, and
also retrieves the settings affecting its operation from there. If this
database is not available, it works with the last or a general setting (if it
is after switching on), then the logging is paused.
  It has a web interface. All data can be queried via WLAN using HTTP in four
formats (CSV, JSON, TXT and XML) and using Modbus/TCP.
